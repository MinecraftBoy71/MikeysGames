# Hello, World!

I'm in the process of building a game server that runs on a Raspberry Pi (or any Linux system). The idea is that you can hook it up to your TV, have your friends
or family get their smartphones or tablets out, and play a game together. The basic idea is a cross between board games and video games like Playstation or XBox.

Board games are usually a bit limited in some way. For example, with Yahtzee it's hard to see the other players score sheets and the scoring is all manual. I 
think Yahtzee would be more fun if all the scoresheets were visible at the same time and automatically scored-- kind of like those scoring systems that most bowling
alleys have these days.
